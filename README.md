# RD-Audio
Typescripted and webpacked variation of the Radius Engine audio library for multichannel Audio

This is an audio library conversion from the Radius general application HTML5 Engine.  
The compiled libary is in the dist folder and is the only javascript file needed to use the library.

Capabilities:

	The Audio Library is capable of managing an arbitrary number of Audio page elements and abstracting away the resource
	management of playing audio clips.  Simply supply the Audio elements you would like to have managed by the Audio Manager
    and place calls to the Manager to start or stop clips from playing.

Clip Attributes:
	
	Every Clip has a name and every instance has a unique identifier managed by the library.  Tell the library to start or to stop
	an instance of a song and it will.
